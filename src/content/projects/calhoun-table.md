A labor of love in walnut. Edward and Christine approached me with a simple brief: build a custom coffee table with mid-century vibes, a glass top, and at least one drawer sized to keep a bottle of cheap vodka at the ready. Constructed during the height of the pandemic, this piece ended up being a bit of an escape for me, resulting in tons of care and details: turned and wedged legs, a patchwork of walnut inlays to correct a few defects, shop made veneers, hand-cut dovetail drawers, wooden drawer slides, and round recessed finger pulls.
