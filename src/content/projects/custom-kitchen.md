As part of a renovation spearheaded by [North Bay Construction](https://sfnorthbayconstruction.com/), I had the opportunity to craft a completely bespoke kitchen for our 1906 San Francisco home. This project provided a unique opportunity to depart from my usual modern aesthetic and create a traditionally-styled kitchen that complements the home's historical character. After designing 15 custom cabinets in CAD to optimize every inch of space, the components were precisely cut by [Neal's CNC](https://www.nealscnc.com/).

Assembly took place in a rented South San Francisco warehouse, followed by crafting solid maple face frames and doors, dovetailing solid white oak drawers, and fabricating numerous floating shelves, dividers, and pull-out organizers. After transforming my garage into a temporary spray booth for finishing, I braved the wonk of century-old floors and walls to install everything myself. This six-month project was a rewarding endeavor, and we couldn't be happier with the result.
