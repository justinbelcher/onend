A pair of floating nightstands for Charlie and his growing family. There are lots of fun details in this one, including grain-matched drawer fronts, rounded case bottoms, custom natural leather drawer pulls, dovetailed soft close doors, and integrated cord routing for that all-important smartphone charger.
