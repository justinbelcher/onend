Such a fun project! Graphic designer [Ryan Kiley](https://ryankiley.com/) wanted to give his home in Portland a personal touch, so he drew these beautiful numbers and I got to work. The numbers were cut out of old growth douglass fir I sources from [Placemakers](https://placemakersinc.com/) in San Mateo, CA, with inlaid white oak on the back for strength.

Dovetail keyholes were cut into the back for invisible Keilverbinder mounting. This project was a fun collaboration, and apparently got a thumbs up from the local mail person!
