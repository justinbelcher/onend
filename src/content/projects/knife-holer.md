We snagged a well-loved butcher block table off Craigslist in late 2020. It was manufactured by Taylor & Ng, a bygone Asian department store here in SF. We were surprised to find out that the "knife holder" attached to the table was only decorative, but it did feature the maker's mark. So I inlayed that mark onto a new functional knife holder made out of white oak.
