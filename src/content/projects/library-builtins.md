Unusable space turned 16 feet of dramatic built-in storage. This design was a collaboration between myself and owners Patrick and Patsy. It paired base cabinet storage with a wall of erratic, Mondrian-esque shelves and cubbies. In truth, the hardest part of this project was getting all 7 modules up into their unit!
