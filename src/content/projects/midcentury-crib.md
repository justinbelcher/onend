A one of a kind crib for some dear friends' first born. I was honored to be asked to design and build a crib for their little one, and decided to go all out in honor of the moment. This knockdown-constructed, mid-century style walnut crib features Niemeyer-inspired shaped end panels, drawbored bridle framing, hand-tapered legs, and an adjustable bed platform for a growing tyke.
