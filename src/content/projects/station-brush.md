A gift for my wife, a hair salon owner in San Francisco, to celebrate finally getting back into the salon during the pandemic. SF was one of the last cities in the nation to allow hair stylists to return to work, so I wanted to mark the occasion with something useful and beautiful. This piece is heavily inspired b [Aspen Golann's](https://www.aspengolann.com/) work, who even provided free guidance on how to make brushes&mdash;thanks Aspen!
