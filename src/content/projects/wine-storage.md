A delightful consequence of living in Northern California is the proliferation of wine club memberships. To tame our overflowing garage storage, I built this 106-bottle wine storage unit. It houses 99 bottles securely, with 7 showcased up front, all angled back for earthquake safety. This was a fun build, and after dealing with hundreds of components I now understand why these things are so expensive.
